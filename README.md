# Hangman

Developed a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess the correct word letter by letter, aided by a provided question from a chosen category. Created a DataFrame using dictionaries, where the keys represent questions and the values are the corresponding answers, with the DataFrame's columns representing different question categories. The project utilized Pandas for data manipulation and regular expressions for pattern matching.
